Beginning of a Connect-N solver. 

The idea is to make it a Minimax algorithm as optimised as gets:
α-β Pruning, End-Game Tables, Symmetry Optimization, and Evaluation Functions.

Until the moment, I have the game properly modelled and functional and the minimax with alpha-beta pruning.

Deepcopy will be replaced by an undo method. 

Next step: depth and evaluate function
