Beginning of a Connect Three solver. 

The idea is to make it a Minimax algorithm as optimised as gets:
α-β Pruning, End-Game Tables, Simmetry Optimization, and Evaluation Functions.

Up to date, I have the game properly modelled and functional.

Deepcopy will be replaced by an undo method. 

Next step: simple Minimax algorithm
